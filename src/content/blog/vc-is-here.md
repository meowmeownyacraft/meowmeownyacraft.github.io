# mmnc is voice chat ready!

this means you can now speak to fellow players, all you have to do is install [one **optional** mod](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat). :3

this mod can be downloaded in prism launcher, or maybe your launcher of choice, or you can install it manually. all up to you!

### so, do i need this mod to play or not?

**no!** this mod is *optional*, so you don't need to install it to play on the server, so don't worry.

however, it is a part of our full experience now and all ready for you to enjoy. no need for third party voice chat services!

### how does it work, what are the benefits?

- you can immediately talk to players without using text chat
- proximity chat, which means you are able to speak to players close to you
- group chats that enable you to talk to people far away
- all the settings you could need, including noise suppression and push to talk
- 3D audio
- you can mute individual players for yourself

### someone is being mean to me in VC!

if you can, absolutely **record evidence**, **report** the meanie to us and **mute** them! we do not support inappropriate behavior in voicechats or any chats.
